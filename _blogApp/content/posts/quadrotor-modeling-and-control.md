## Description 

A quadcopter, also called a quadrotor helicopter or quadrotor, is a multirotor helicopter that is lifted and propelled by four rotors (see Figure 1). Quadcopters are classified as rotorcraft, as opposed to fixed-wing aircraft, because their lift is generated by a set of rotors (vertically oriented propellers).

Unlike most helicopters, quadcopters use two sets of identical fixed pitched propellers; two clockwise (CW) and two counter-clockwise (CCW). These use variation of RPM to control lift and torque. Control of vehicle motion is achieved by altering the rotation rate of one or more rotor discs, thereby changing its torque load and thrust/lift characteristics.[Wikipedia]

## How it works
The quadcopter is controlled by the angular speeds of four electric motors. From Figure 2 it can be observed that the motor \\( M_i \\) (for \\(i=1,...,4\\)) produces the force \\( f_i \\) and the torque \\( \tau{M_i} \\).

As shown in Figure 3 The thrust and the torque generated by each motor produce : 

* the main thrust, 
* the yaw torque, 
* the pitch torque, and 
* the roll torque.

The propellers rotations sens must be arranged to tend to cancel gyroscopic effects and aerodynamic torques in trimmed flight as follow :

* The front (\\(M_1\\)) and the rear (\\(M_3\\)) motors rotate **counter-clockwise**, 

* while the left (\\(M_2\\)) and right (\\(M_4\\)) motors rotate **clockwise**



## Quadcopter direction control

### Main thrust 

Is obtained by increasing or decreasing the sum of individual thrusts of each motor for taking-up and taking-down respectively (Figure 4.c and 4.g). 


###  Pitch motion

Is obtained by increasing the speed of the rear motor \\( M_3 \\) while reducing the speed of the front motor \\( M_1 \\) for the clockwise direction (Figure 4.e) and vis-versa for the anticlockwise direction (Figure 4.f).


### Roll motion 

Is obtained by increasing the speed of the rear motor \\( M_4 \\) while reducing the speed of the front motor \\( M_2 \\)  (Figure 4.d) for the clockwise direction and vise-versa the for the anticlockwise direction (Figure 4.h).

###  Yaw motion

Is obtained by increasing the torque of the front and rear motors \\( \tau_{M_1} \\) and \\( \tau_{M_3} \\), respectively) while decreasing the torque of the lateral motors (\\( \tau_{M_2} \\) and \\( \tau_{M_4} \\), respectively)  (Figure 4.b) and vise-versa the anticlockwise direction (Figure 4.a). 

Such motions can be accomplished while maintaining the total thrust constant, see Figure 2.

## Difference between a MultiCopter and a UAV/Drone?

A multicopter becomes a UAV or Drone when it is capable of autonomous flight.  Normally this means taking the accelerometer and gyro information and combining it with barometer and GPS data so the flight controller understands not only it’s orientation but also it’s position.
