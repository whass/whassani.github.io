# Want to hire me ?

<div class="published"><span>Great news, keep reading!</span></div>

Currently I'm mostly focused on research & developpment in control engineering, but I'm open to other kind of missions.

## What I Can Do For You

Here's an incomplete list of the things I can help you with


* **Development of Control laws Strategies or improve the existing ones**
* **Design of a Human-Machine Interaction Strategies**
* **Dynamical System Modeling and Optimization**
* **Programming your MicroController based board**
* Development of a simulation model using Matlab/Simulink, C/C++ or Pyhton
* Speed prototyping using dSPACE board


## Why I Can Help

### - I've a deep knowledge in control engineering .....

*As a PhD I've developed new control strategies that have been experimentally tested, published in most prestigious conferences and revues in robotics and Control (IROS, CDC, RSS,...).*


### - I've several years of experience in electronics and embedded system design for robotics and automated industrial systems.

*I occupied several engineer positions and developed many systems, including the design and the development. I can cite, a microconroller-based boards for automated industrial systems, servo-controllers, robot benchmark, wireless system network, multichannel signal acquisition systems, etc.*


### - I worked in an international environments .....

*I was involved in many international projects, including, industrial and academic from Finland, Germany, Spain, Turkey, South Korea.*


Since all this is just me talking, let's see some video of my previous projects.
