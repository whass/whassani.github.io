description: The complete dynamics of an aircraft, taking into account aero-elastic effects, flexibility of the wings, internal dynamics of the engine and the whole set of changing variables are quite complex and somewhat.

The quad-rotor model is obtained by representing the aircraft as a solid body evolving in a three dimensional space and subject to the main thrust and three torques: pitch, roll and yaw.

The quad-rotor mini-rotorcraft is controlled by the angular speeds of four electric motors as shown in Fig. 2.1. Each motor produces a thrust and a torque, whose combination generates the main thrust, the yaw torque, the pitch torque, and the roll torque acting on the quad-rotor.
